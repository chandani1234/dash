<p>Angular 8 is a JavaScript framework for building web applications and apps in JavaScript, html, and TypeScript, which is a superset of JavaScript. Angular provides built-in features for animation, http service, and materials which in turn has features such as auto-complete, navigation, toolbar, menus, etc. The code is written in TypeScript, which compiles to JavaScript and displays the same in the browser.
